Using geckodriver rather than the chromedriver.
Does not filter ALL ads, but was definately getting more adverts when using chrome.

Was Using ChromeDriver instead of Gecko per the suggestion of a friend.
	pro:
	     - just about everything has Chrome OR Chromium installed
	     - After clicking on the first video, youtube autoplays
	con:
	     - does not naturally filter ads on YouTube
	     ...and I personally don't like chrome that much...

If you have uBlock installed on a local firefox installation, should be able to copy the xpi from:
~/.mozilla/firefox/[profileID].default-esr/extensions/uBlock0@raymondhill.net.xpi
